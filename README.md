# sentiment-analysis

We used a pre-trained neural network like XLNet for this project to predict the sentiment of movie reviews taken from a large data set before and after data augmentation. For this purpose, we took advantage of different libraries from Python to conduct data wrangling, exploratory analysis, model building, training, and evaluation.
